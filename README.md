## A quick project for using Tables in Excel

This was the initial data, which we had to turn into a table in order to answer a few brief questions.

#### First, we had to order the data by highest in each subject

This was done by creating a table in excel, by selecting all the cells and then the create table button. This meant that the data would remain in rows, rather than destroying the data by reorganising a column without moving the rows correctly.

#### Next, we had to calculate the Average score per student.

We create the additional column by using an AVG function across the cells, and then filter by this average score to order the results. I have also applied conditional formatting to the cells to highlight the higher scores.

#### Finally, we had to compare each students top score.

This was done by creating another column, this time using a MAX function. Conditional formatting was applied again. Note that for the prior column the conditional formatting has remained, and we can still easily see who got the highest average despite it now being ordered by highest indiviual score.

#### Additional KPIs

I highlighted the top scores for each subject, and additionally calculated the average score per subject, to allow comparison against individual scores in each subject. 

I then also created a quick bar chart for Highest score for each student, just to quickly compare the students against each other.
